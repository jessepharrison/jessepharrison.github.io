## Environment maintenance & design

### r-env

**R / RStudio container on [Puhti supercomputer](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/systems-puhti/)**

#### Description

r-env is an [Apptainer container](https://apptainer.org/) including R, RStudio Server and TensorFlow. Many of the 1300+ R packages included offer support for parallel computing (including MPI jobs) and geospatial analyses.

#### Tasks

2019-2022:

-   Design, implementation and maintenance on Puhti (Finnish national supercomputing cluster)
-   Research support (500+ users) and maintaining [technical user documentation](https://docs.csc.fi/apps/r-env/)
-   R environment design for the [CSC Sensitive Data Desktop](https://docs.csc.fi/data/sensitive-data/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chipster microbiome analysis

**Semi-automated tools for microbial community metabarcoding analysis**

#### Description

Chipster is a [user-friendly analysis software](https://chipster.rahtiapp.fi/home) for next-generation sequencing data, such as scRNA-seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and microbial community metabarcoding data.

#### Tasks

2019-2021:

-   Developed [a semi-automated toolbox](https://chipster.rahtiapp.fi/manual/tools-ngs.html#microanalysis) for OTU-based microbial community comparisons
