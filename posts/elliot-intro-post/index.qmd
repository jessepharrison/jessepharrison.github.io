[See here for a blog post on the launch of the Horizon Europe ELLIOT project](https://csc.fi/en/news/elliot-project-launched-csc-contributing-to-development-of-european-ai/), published on the CSC website. Examples of CSC contributions to the project include supporting the pretraining of large-scale foundation models using the LUMI supercomputer, participating in improving the core capabilities of the resulting models, and model fine-tuning.
