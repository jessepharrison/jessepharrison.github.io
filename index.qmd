#### **About**

I work as a Development Manager at CSC - IT Center for Science, where my current tasks involve leading the AI & Data Analytics (AIDA) group. I have also worked as the Scientific Coordinator of the [Horizon Europe BioDT project](https://biodt.eu/) and as a Work Package lead for [H2020 PerMedCoE](https://permedcoe.eu/).

I hold the title of Docent (Associate Professor) in Environmental Sciences at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-biological-and-environmental-sciences).

My previous responsibilities have included R environment design and support on CSC computing platforms, bioinformatics software tool development, and teaching courses on R and bioinformatics.

Prior to joining CSC, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Universities of Edinburgh, Vienna, Helsinki and Turku.
