#### **About**

I work as the Development Manager of the [AI & Data Analytics (AIDA) group](https://csc.fi/en/our-expertise/ai-and-data-analytics/) at CSC - IT Center for Science. My previous roles at CSC have included working as the Scientific Coordinator of the [Horizon Europe BioDT project](https://biodt.eu/) and as a Senior Data Scientist. 

I hold the title of Docent (Associate Professor) in Environmental Sciences at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-biological-and-environmental-sciences). Prior to joining CSC, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Universities of Edinburgh, Vienna, Helsinki and Turku.
